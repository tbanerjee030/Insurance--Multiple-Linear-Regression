# Insurance--Multiple-Linear-Regression
Insurance- Multiple Linear Regression
Introduction:

This project aims to explore the relationship between various factors and insurance premiums using multiple linear regression analysis. Multiple linear regression is a statistical method used to analyze the relationship between two or more independent variables and a dependent variable. In the context of insurance premiums, the objective is to understand how factors such as age, gender, BMI (Body Mass Index), smoking status, and other relevant variables affect the cost of insurance.

Data:

The dataset used for this analysis contains information on insurance premiums and several attributes of policyholders. These attributes include:

Age: Age of the policyholder.
Gender: Gender of the policyholder (Male or Female).
BMI: Body Mass Index of the policyholder.
Children: Number of children/dependents covered by the insurance policy.
Smoker: Smoking status of the policyholder (Yes or No).
Region: Geographic region of the policyholder (Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, Southwest).
Charges: Insurance premiums charged to the policyholder.
The dataset is assumed to be clean and preprocessed for the purpose of this analysis.

Analysis:

Multiple linear regression will be employed to analyze the relationship between the independent variables (age, gender, BMI, children, smoker, and region) and the dependent variable (insurance expenses). The model will be built using the ordinary least squares (OLS) method, which aims to minimize the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values of the dependent variable.

Model Evaluation:

The performance of the multiple linear regression model will be evaluated using various metrics, including:

R-squared (R2) Score: This metric indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): This metric measures the average deviation of the predicted values from the actual values.
Residual Analysis: Residuals will be examined to ensure that they are normally distributed and exhibit homoscedasticity (constant variance).
Conclusion:

The results of the multiple linear regression analysis will be interpreted to understand the impact of each independent variable on insurance premiums. Insights gained from the analysis can be used by insurance companies to refine their pricing strategies and better understand the risk factors associated with different policyholders.

Note - This analysis assumes that the relationship between the independent variables and insurance premiums is linear and that there are no significant interactions between the independent variables. Assumptions of multiple linear regression will be validated during the analysis process.
